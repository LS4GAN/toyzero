The toyzero package provides first steps toward [[https://ls4gan.github.io/][LS4GAN]].  See also [[file:next-steps.org]]

* Goals
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: goals
:END:

After some pre-requirements are met, this package automates the
preparation for and running of various Wire-Cell Toolkit jobs in order
to produce some initial datasets for initial exploration of the LS4GAN
concept.

The final results are in the form raw ADC (Z-axis) waveform arrays in
per-channel rows (Y-axis) of time-sampled columns (X-axis).  Each
array spans one of three wire planes from one of six anode plane
assemblies (APA) of the ProtoDUNE-SP detector.

There are two domains named *real* and *fake* (both simulated in toyzero).
The *real* domain uses the full, best known 2D response model. The *fake*
domain uses an intentionally "more wrong" quasi-1D model which is
derived from the 2D model by zeroing all responses except those
covering the central wire of interest.  (Note that this quasi-1D model
is not the same of the "yet more wronger" 1D model as q1D includes the
variation within the central wire region.)

For this initial development we accept a number of simplifying
"cheats" which we will rectify as we gain experience and develop the
next phase.  They are at least the following:

- Use of simulation for both "real" and "fake".  Eventually, "real"
  will be detector data and "fake" will from our best available
  simulation (currently 2D Wire Cell).  We may use paired data for
  evaluating the technique in this stage but can not rely on it going
  forward.

- Our initial /data tier/ is that of *ADC waveforms* and those from only
  ionization electrons from *ideal tracks* and in particular *excluding
  noise* effects.  We eventually will use realistic track simulation
  (Geant4) and will include noise.  When adding noise we will switch
  to a /data tier/ of *reconstructed signal waveforms*.  To produce them
  we will include *noise models* in the simulation and apply *noise
  filtering* to both the fake simulation and the real detector data
  just prior to applying *signal processing*.  We may stop there or go
  one step further and apply Wire-Cell *3D tomographic imaging* to form
  our data tier.  Each step brings "real" and "fake" closer and thus
  allows LS4GAN to expend its deep neural nodes to find ever more
  subtle differences.

* Prepare
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: prepare
:END:

This package requires a few user environment settings to support use
of Wire-Cell Toolkit and various Python packages.  We will assume
[[https://direnv.net/][direnv]] is used to manage the environment.  To use *another environment
management system*, translate the contents of the example [[file:dot.envrc][dot.envrc]].

** Environment
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: env
:END:

A one time setup of direnv:

#+begin_example
  $ cd toyzero
  $ cp dot.envrc .envrc
  $ emacs .envrc  # edit to taste
  $ direnv allow
#+end_example

** Check Wire-Cell Toolkit
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: checks
:END:

The Wire-Cell Toolkit program ~wire-cell~ and its libraries are
required.  See https://wirecell.bnl.gov/ for installation information.
Check if WCT is available with these commands:

#+begin_example
  $ wire-cell --help
  $ wcsonnet wirecell.jsonnet
  $ echo $WIRECELL_PATH
#+end_example

The ~WIRECELL_PATH~ should include at least the ~cfg/~ directory provided
by WCT.  This ~toyzero~ package provides additional configuration in
[[file:cfg/][./cfg]] which will found automatically.

** Python
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: python
:END:

The stand-alone ~wire-cell-python~ package, the ~snakemake~ program and
various other Python 3 packages are required.  

#+begin_example
  $ cd toyzero
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt
#+end_example

Some checks:

#+begin_example
  $ wirecell-<TAB>
  $ wirecell-util --help
  $ snakemake --help
#+end_example

See also section [[Hacking]] for info on providing a developer version of
~wire-cell-python~ code.

* Usage
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: usage
:END:

Exercising toyzero will automatically download various files from
Wire-Cell GitHub and run various programs.  In principle, the user
need run only:

#+begin_example
  $ snakemake -jall all
#+end_example

This can take ten minutes or so depending on how fast your CPU is.
To see what is produced:

#+begin_example
  $ tree data plots
#+end_example

To generate the minimum needed for the "images" data tier (see below)
you can do:

#+begin_example
  $ snakemake -jall just_images
#+end_example

By default, the above does not retain intermediate data files from the
"depos", "wires", "resp" and "frames" data tier files (see below for
descriptions), only keeping "images".  To keep the intermediates you
may run as:

#+begin_example
  $ snakemake -jall just_images --notemp
#+end_example

A one "event" run produce about 2MB of "images" and 360 MB if
intermediates are kept.

More information on the use of ~snakemake~ in toyzero is below and in
sections [[Configuration]] and [[Snakemake]].

* Details
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: details
:END:

Looking into the [[file:Snakefile][Snakefile]] one will see the ~all~ target aggregates a
number of ~all_*~ sub-targets.  You may run each ordered, piece-wise
manner:

#+begin_example
  $ snakemake -jall all_resp
  $ snakemake -jall all_wires
  $ snakemake -jall all_depos
  $ snakemake -jall all_frames
  $ snakemake -jall all_images
#+end_example

Each of these steps are described more in the next subsections.

** resp
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: resp
:END:


The ~all_resp~ target downloads 2D WCT "response file" and from it
derives the quasi-1D response file.  then various diagnostic plots are
made for each.

Visualization of q1D and 2D responses are generated and shown below.
First "fake" q1D and "real" 2D.  These show the instantaneous induced
current (Z-axis) on a "wire of interest" over the drift path of an
electron.  One row gives the response for an electron path that begins
at the transverse (aka "pitch") location relative to the wire center
and as given on the Y-axis.  Along that path/row, the Z/color value of
each pixel gives the instantaneous current at a moment of time
(X-axis).

Note, the actual paths follow some trajectory in space but this
information is not important for applying the response (though is very
important for calculating the responses).  Also note, the current is
in a "signed log10" unit with an arbitrary scaling in order to see
both fine and gross features.

** wires
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: wires
:END:

The ~all_wires~ target downloads WCT "wires file" and makes a multipage
PDF file with diagnostic plots at [[file:plots/wires-diagnostic.pdf]].

Most of these pages may show content that is too esoteric for most
users and they exhaustively cover all six protodune APAs.  However,
the pages showing wire segments may be instructive.  For the most
part, they can be ignored as "wires files" are typically well tested
prior to making them available.

** depos
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: depos
:END:

The ~all_depos~ target generates sets of ionization point depositions
for input to the WCT simulation.  It produces a file:

#+begin_example
  data/depos/depos.npz
#+end_example

The file is in Numpy format with three types of arrays named like:

#+begin_example
  depo_data_<N>
  depo_info_<N>
  track_info_<N>
#+end_example

We will ignore the ~info~ arrays here.

The ~<N>~ counts the set of depos which are generated together (eg, an
"event").  The ~data~ arrays are 2D of shape ~(n, 7)~ where ~n~ is the
number of depositions over all tracks in the "event" and is
O(100k-1M).  Each depo is a 7-tuple with elements:

1. time
2. number of electrons
3. X position
4. Y position
5. Z position
6. longitudinal extent (zero here)
7. transverse extent (zero here)

A simple summary diagnostic plot for the first "event" is generated
showing distribution of depo times and the depo locations.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 90%
[[file:plots/depos-diagnostic.png]]

The ~track_info_<N>~ arrays are [[https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.rec.html][numpy structured arrays]] with these
"columns":

- pmin :: 3-vector holding track start point in Cartesian coordinates (mm)
- pmax :: 3-vector holding track end point in Cartesian coordinates  (mm)
- tmin :: time at start point (ns)
- tmax :: time at end point (ns)
- step :: distance between steps along track (mm)
- eper :: number of ionization electrons at each step

Each of these columns have one row per "track" (line source) in the
"event" number ~<N>~.  By default their length is 10.

** frames
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: frames
:END:

The ~all_frames~ target generates "frame" data from depos by running the
Wire-Cell simulation.  The "frame" file format is described elsewhere.
For here, we treat it as a temporary.


** images
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: images
:END:


The ~all_images~ target processes each "frame" data to produce one 2D
image for each of three wire planes of each of six anode plane
assemblies.  The file name and name of the single array in the file
match.  For example:

#+begin_example
❯ wirecell-util npzls data/images/real/protodune-orig-0-1-W.npz 
protodune-orig-0-1-W (960, 6000)
#+end_example

These image arrays have shape ~(nchan, ntick)~.  That is each row is the
waveform from one channel and has ~ntick=6000~ samples (3ms).  When
visualized with matplotlib's ~imshow()~ you will see channels as Y-axis,
tics as X-axis.

This "W" file holds one array of 960 channels and 6000 sample time
"ticks" and is from index=0 from the "real" data, APA ID 1 and plane
"W" (collection plane aka plane 2 counting from 0).  "U" and "V" are
induction planes and each will have 800 channels and the
contemporaneous 6000 ticks.

* Plotting
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: plotting
:END:

Diagnostic plots for each APA of the first event are made in PDF, PNG
and SVG with different color maps to explore how best to display the
information.  These image pose problems as they are relatively high
resolution and high dynamic range but are also sparse.  As such we
must take care that some visualization will produce very *misleading
artifacts*.

** Image formats
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: imgfmt
:END:


- png :: At ~matplotlib~ default DPI expect loss of visual data due to
  the resolution being low and potentially due to low values falling
  into the "center" color of the color map.  Increasing DPI can help
  at the cost of larger files.  Exploring different color maps follows.

- pdf :: Likely best format to use for accuracy.  However *beware of
  antialiasing* that many PDF viewers apply to make images and text
  look "prettier".  It can obscure features and add artifacts.

- svg :: Much of the benefits of PDF but can be inlined in HTML.

As an example of DPI problems, compare the two images below.  The
first is a high-DPI PNG rendering (by NETPBM) from the original PDF
made by ~matplotlib~ and the second is a PNG directly from ~matplotlib~ at
its default DPI.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 90%
[[file:plots/hidpi/frames-fake-apa0.png]]

to the same data as PNG at default DPI from matplotlib:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 90%
[[file:plots/frames-fake-apa0.png]]


If you need more zoom from your ~evince~ PDF viewer try
#+begin_example
❯ gsettings set org.gnome.Evince page-cache-size 2014
#+end_example

** Color maps
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: cmap
:END:

Selecting a good [[https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/colormap_reference.html][color map]] can have a big impact.  Some guidance:

- For bipolar data of large dynamic range consider using "seismic" and
  symmetric ranges (~vmin/vmax~).

- For bipolar data with low dynamic range, select a symmetric color
  map such as "coolwarm" and use a masked array to remove the 0 value.

- Avoid "rainbow" color maps with a large central region of a nearly
  common color.

The ~wire-cell-python~ package provides a command to easily visualize a
2D Numpy image array in a file with many plotting parameters exposed
as command line options:

#+begin_example
  ❯ wirecell-util npz-to-img --help
  Usage: wirecell-util npz-to-img [OPTIONS] NPZFILE

    Make an image from an array in an numpy file.

  Options:
    -o, --output TEXT    Output image file
    -a, --array TEXT     Array to plot
    -c, --cmap TEXT      Color map
    -b, --baseline TEXT  Apply median baseline subtraction or if number,
                         subtract directly
    -m, --mask TEXT      Value or range to mask, range is lower-edge inclusive
    --vmin TEXT          Minimum value (z/color axis)
    --vmax TEXT          Maximum value (z/color axis)
    --dpi TEXT           The dots-per-inch resolution
    -z, --zoom TEXT      A zoom range as 'rmin:rmax,cmin:cmax'
    --help               Show this message and exit.

  ❯ wirecell-util npz-to-img --cmap Spectral \
     --zoom 300:500,0:1000 --mask 0 --vmin -50 --vmax 50 \
     --dpi 600 --baseline=median \

* Configuration
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: config
:END:

By default, ~toyzero~ operates as a generator.  That is, every time a
particular version is run it should always produce essentially an
identical result.

Some high-level parameters may be changed to produce different
results.  These can be controlled by a configuration file.  For
example the default configuration is held in:

#+include: toyzero.yaml src yaml

To customize,

#+begin_example
  $ cp toyzero.yaml mycfg.yaml
  $ emacs mycfg.yaml
  $ snakemake -jall --configfile mycfg.yaml all
#+end_example

Files carry identical names between the different variant runs.  To
avoid collision be sure to set ~datadir~ and ~plotdir~ to locations not
yet used.

You may also customize specific parameters from the command line:

#+begin_example
  $ snakemake -jall --config outdir=junk ntracks=10 all_depos
  $ eom junk/plots/depos-diagnostic.png 
#+end_example

A ~--config~ wins over an entry in a ~--configfile~.  Note, a single
~--config~ flag should be used to indicate all parameter overrides.
Adding another ~--config~ will negate all prior.

* Snakemake
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: snake
:END:

As already introduced, this "toyzero" package is organized around a
~snakemake~ [[file:Snakefile]] which provides automated running of a
/directed, acyclic graph/ (DAG).  A node of the DAG is a process and
directional edges are formed through input or output files.  

It is instructive to visualize the overall DAG and ~snakemake~ provides
this by running:

#+begin_src shell :exports both :results none
  snakemake --dag all just_images > toyzero-all-dag.dot
  dot -Tsvg -o toyzero-all-dag.svg toyzero-all-dag.dot
  dot -Tpdf -o toyzero-all-dag.pdf toyzero-all-dag.dot
#+end_src

Below is the result as SVG or download the [[file:toyzero-all-dag.pdf]] to
zoom around.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 90%
[[file:toyzero-all-dag.svg]]

The "real" documentation on toyzero *is* the Snakefile as it describes
exactly what is run.  In principle, with the Snakefile one can always
reproduce its results.  In practice changes in the ~wire-cell~ and
~wirecell-*~ programs, or external data can lead to unexpected changes.


* Hacking
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: hack
:END:

Much of the ~toyzero~ package relies on the ~wire-cell-python~ package.
You can develop that code locally (instead of push to GitHub +
reinstall).  We can leverage the ~direnv~ environment for ~toyzero~ to do
so like:

#+begin_example
  $ git clone git@github.com:wirecell/wire-cell-python.git
  $ cd wire-cell-python/
  $ pip install -U -e .
#+end_example

You can now hack on wire-cell-python and your changes are immediately
made available.  If the changes are generally useful, please consider
making a PR!
