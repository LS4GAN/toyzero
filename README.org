Bare first steps toward LS4GAN.  *still work in progress*

* Goals
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: goals
:END:

After some pre-requirements are met, this package automates the
preparation for and running of various Wire-Cell Toolkit jobs in order
to produce some initial datasets for initial exploration of the LS4GAN
concept.

The final results are in the form raw ADC waveform arrays in
per-channel rows of sampled columns.  Each array spans one of three
wire planes from one of six anode plane assemblies (APA) of the
ProtoDUNE-SP detector.

There are two data sets *real* and *fake*.  The *real* uses the full, best
known 2D response model and the *fake* uses an intentionally wrong
quasi-1D model which is derived from the 2D model by zeroing all
responses except those for the central wire.  (Note that this quasi-1D
model is not the same of the even less accurate 1D model as it
includes the variation within the central wire region.)

For this initial development we accept a number of simplifying
"cheats" which we will rectify as we gain experience.  They are at
least the following:

- Use of simulation for both "real" and "fake".  Eventually, "real"
  will be detector data and "fake" will from our best available
  simulation (currently 2D Wire Cell).  We may use paired data for
  evaluating the technique in this stage but can not rely on it going
  forward.

- Our initial /data tier/ is that of *ADC waveforms* and those from only
  ionization electrons from *ideal tracks* and in particular *excluding
  noise* effects.  We eventually will use realistic track simulation
  (Geant4) and will include noise.  When adding noise we will switch
  to a /data tier/ of *reconstructed signal waveforms*.  To produce them
  we will include *noise models* in the simulation and apply *noise
  filtering* to both the fake simulation and the real detector data
  just prior to applying *signal processing*.


* Prepare
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: prepare
:END:

This package requires a few user environment settings to support use
of Wire-Cell Toolkit and various Python packages.  We will assume
[[https://direnv.net/][direnv]] is used to manage the environment.  To use *another environment
management system*, translate the contents of the example [[file:dot.envrc][dot.envrc]].

** Environment
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: env
:END:

A one time setup of direnv:

#+begin_example
  $ cd toyzero
  $ cp dot.envrc .envrc
  $ emacs .envrc  # edit to taste
  $ direnv allow
#+end_example

** Check Wire-Cell Toolkit
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: checks
:END:

The Wire-Cell Toolkit program ~wire-cell~ and its libraries are
required.  See https://wirecell.bnl.gov/ for installation information.
Check if WCT is available with these commands:

#+begin_example
  $ wire-cell --help
  $ wcsonnet wirecell.jsonnet
  $ echo $WIRECELL_PATH
#+end_example

The ~WIRECELL_PATH~ should include at least the ~cfg/~ directory provided
by WCT.  This ~toyzero~ package provides additional configuration in
[[file:cfg/][./cfg]] which will found automatically.

** Python
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: python
:END:

The stand-alone ~wire-cell-python~ package, the ~snakemake~ program and
various other Python 3 packages are required.  

#+begin_example
  $ cd toyzero
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt
#+end_example

Some checks:

#+begin_example
  $ wirecell-<TAB>
  $ wirecell-util --help
  $ snakemake --help
#+end_example

*** Hacking
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: hack
:END:

The above installs WCT python for use.  To develop that code without
having to go through many GitHub pushes we can leverage the ~direnv~
environment for ~toyzero~ use:

#+begin_example
  $ git clone git@github.com:wirecell/wire-cell-python.git
  $ cd wire-cell-python/
  $ pip install -U -e .
#+end_example

You can now hack on wire-cell-python and your changes are immediately
made available.

* Usage
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: usage
:END:

Exercising toyzero will automatically download various files from
Wire-Cell GitHub and run various programs.  

#+begin_export 
  $ snakemake -jall all
  $ tree data plots
#+end_export

This can take ten minutes or so depending on how fast your CPU is.

* Details
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: details
:END:

Looking into the [[file:Snakefile][Snakefile]] one will see the ~all~ target aggregates a
number of ~all_*~ sub-targets.

** resp
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: resp
:END:


The ~all_resp~ target gets 2D WCT "response file" and derive from it
quasi-1D response file and make some diagnostic plots for each.

Visualization of q1D and 2D responses are generated and shown below.
First "fake" q1D and "real" 2D.  These show the instantaneous induced
current (Z-axis) on a "wire of interest" for an that started at the
transverse pitch direction (Y-axis) when it is at the moment of time
(X-axis).  Note, the current is in log10 units.

** wires
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: wires
:END:

The ~all_wires~ target gets WCT "wires file" and makes a multipage PDF
file with diagnostic plots at [[file:plots/wires-diagnostic.pdf]].  Most
of these pages may be too esoteric for most users and they
exhaustively cover all six protodune APAs.  However, the pages showing
wire segments may be instructive.

** depos
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: depos
:END:

The ~all_depos~ target generates sets of ionization point depositions
for input to the WCT simulation.  It produces a file:

#+begin_example
  data/{wire}-depos.npz
#+end_example

Where ~{wire}~ names the wires file.  The file is in Numpy format with
arrays named like:

#+begin_example
  depo_data_<N>
  depo_info_<N>
#+end_example

The ~<N>~ counts a set of depos which are generated together (eg, an
"event").  The ~data~ arrays are 2D of shape ~(7, n)~ where ~n~ is the number
of depositions, O(1M).  Each depo is a 7-tuple with elements:

1. time
2. number of electrons
3. X position
4. Y position
5. Z position
6. longitudinal extent (zero here)
7. transverse extent (zero here)

Additional ~info~ arrays will be found in the file and can be
ignored here.

A simple summary diagnostic plot for the first "event" is generated
showing distribution of depo times and the depo locations.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 90%
[[file:plots/depos-diagnostic.png]]

** frames
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: frames
:END:

The ~all_frames~ target generates "frame" data from depos by running the
Wire-Cell simulation.  The "frame" file format is described elsewhere.
For here, we treat it as a temporary.

Diagnostic plots for each APA of the first event are made in PDF and
PNG.  Frame data is both very sparse and also very high resolution and
this causes substantial problems for visualization.  Default
visualization often shows *misleading artifacts*.

- png :: at default DPI for ~matplotlib~ expect loss of visual data due
  to PNG resolution lower than data and due to zero or close to zero
  falling into the background color.  Increasing DPI can help at the
  cost of larger files.

- pdf :: most likely to correctly represent that data.  However *beware
  of antialiasing* that many PDF viewers apply to make images and text
  look "prettier".  This will also obscure features and add artifacts.

As an example, compare the two images below.  The first is a high-DPI
PNG rendering (by NETPBM) from the original PDF made by ~matplotlib~ and
the second is a PNG directly from ~matplotlib~ at its default DPI.

Some tips to deal with resolution issues

- A PDF hint, if you want more zoom from your ~evince~:
#+begin_example
❯ gsettings set org.gnome.Evince page-cache-size 2014
#+end_example

- Try [[https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/colormap_reference.html][different color maps]].  If the data has a large enough dynamic
  range, consider a diverging color map with a white center (eg
  "seismic").  If this places too many low values into the center
  color bin then use a continuous color map which changes color at the
  center and then use a masked array (~numpy.ma.array~) with the central
  value (eg 0) masked (eg or "coolwarm" or "Spectral" - see examples
  below).  One example shown below.  Avoid all "rainbow" maps with a
  green swath in the center and any ending in white such as "terrain".

** images
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: images
:END:


The ~all_images~ target processes each "frame" data to produce one 2D
image for each of three wire planes of each of six anode plane
assemblies.  The file name and name of the single array in the file
match.  For example:

#+begin_example
❯ wirecell-util npzls data/images/real/protodune-orig-0-1-W.npz 
protodune-orig-0-1-W (960, 6000)
#+end_example

This file holds one array of 960 channels and 6000 sample time "ticks"
and is from index=0 from the "real" data, APA ID 1 and plane "W"
(collection plane aka plane 2 counting from 0).  "U" and "V" are
induction planes and each will have 800 channels and the
contemporaneous 6000 ticks.

The array may be visualized with many options with this command:

#+begin_example
  ❯ wirecell-util npz-to-img --help
  Usage: wirecell-util npz-to-img [OPTIONS] NPZFILE

    Make an image from an array in an numpy file.

  Options:
    -o, --output TEXT    Output image file
    -a, --array TEXT     Array to plot
    -c, --cmap TEXT      Color map
    -b, --baseline TEXT  Apply median baseline subtraction or if number,
                         subtract directly
    -m, --mask TEXT      Value or range to mask, range is lower-edge inclusive
    --vmin TEXT          Minimum value (z/color axis)
    --vmax TEXT          Maximum value (z/color axis)
    --dpi TEXT           The dots-per-inch resolution
    -z, --zoom TEXT      A zoom range as 'rmin:rmax,cmin:cmax'
    --help               Show this message and exit.

  ❯ wirecell-util npz-to-img --cmap Spectral \
     --zoom 400:600,700:1300 --mask 0 --vmin -3 --vmax 3 \
     --dpi 600 --baseline=median \
     -o junk.png data/images/real/protodune-orig-0-5-U.npz
